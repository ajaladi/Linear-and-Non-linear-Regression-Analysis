# Linear-and-Non-linear-Regression-Analysis

## Description:
This project demonstrates the implementation of both linear and non-linear regression models to analyze and predict data patterns. It includes solutions to problems involving different types of regression models, such as 1D-no-noise, 2D-noisy, and various polynomial fits, implemented during the Homework 4 of the course at George Mason University.

## Technologies Used:
-- Python
-- NumPy
-- Matplotlib

## Features:
-- Implementation of linear regression in noisy and non-noisy environments.
-- Use of gradient descent to optimize regression models.
-- Evaluation of model performance using different metrics.
